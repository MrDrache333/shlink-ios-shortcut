# shlink-ios-shortcut
I'm using this tool for some time now and I love it.
Because I use it a lot on Apple Devices and also love the Shortcuts-app and their possibilities, I've created a shortcut to create links with Shlink.

**Supported Features**
- Create URLs without Custom Slug
- Create URLs with Custom Slug
- Respond to Errors during Link-Creation (Invalid Arguments, Slug already In Use etc.)
- Copy Short-URL to Clipboard
- Share URL with iOS/macOS Share-Sheet
- Create URLs by share Links to the Shortcut
- Create URLs by selecting Links on macOS and choose "Services" via Rightclick on the Link


**Coming Features**
- Request One ðŸ˜‰ 
- Maybe some sort of Deleting Shortcuts or adding expiration/ limitation to them while creating
- Maybe some sort of requesting visiting Stats
- Maybe direct display of the QR-Code after creation
